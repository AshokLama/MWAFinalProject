Modern Web Applications CS572
Final Project
Application specifications and requirements

It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements. Team leaders will discuss with their team
members an idea and write down a short description for it, set your goals and have a clear scope. Your
project must use the following:

• Implement a login based system (JWT).
• Use UI Components https://angular.io/resources

Note: Chat and e-commerce/cart applications are not allowed. Set a more challenging goal.

Technical information
• You must use all the technologies we learned in our course (MEAN stack).
• Design your own DB, skeleton and app structure (let me know if you need help with this). Start
by planning your screens and split your work between all members. (use DB as a service – Atlas).
• It’s advised that every team member is responsible for implementing one use-case or project
component from start to end.
• All Angular routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes)
• All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes)
• Team leads will create one new Git repo and invite their team members as contributors. All
team members must push to the same repo. Use branching.
• A daily push is required for each member to track your code and performance. If you miss a
push that will affect your final grade.
• Do not push any private key of any service to Git. (If found, your account will be terminated and
you may be legally sued by service providers). Write your keys in a config file (npm i dotenv) and
add the filename to .gitignore
• Do not spend more than two hours on a problem, move on, or find an alternative.
